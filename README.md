# PHPReservations
This project is just a simple homework, and a real documentation is not needed.

But if you wanna train yourself with PHP database or SQL there is a list of exercices to have fun with.

## SQL
You should use the file reservations.sql inside data and upload in your own localhost / server and begin the exercices

## XML
There is the files on the project already, you can just use the function

```simplexml_load_file
